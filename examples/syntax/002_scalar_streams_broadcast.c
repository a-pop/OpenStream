/* Example of the use of peek operations on scalar streams to enable
   broadcast patterns (single producer, multiple consumers).  This is
   achieved by using "peek" and "tick" operations, the former giving
   access to data within the stream similarly to an "input" clause
   (albeit without consuming the data) and the latter allowing to
   advance the position in the stream, discarding data.

   Note that peek/tick are only provided as "syntactic sugar", which
   can be expressed with the more classical input/output clauses,
   though with a heavier syntax:

   #pragma omp task peek (x)
     { ... }
   <=>
   int window[1]; // windowed access
   #pragma omp task input (x >> window[0]) // 0-burst access
     { ... }

   #pragma omp tick (x)
   <=>
   #pragma omp task input (x)
     {;} // codeless task
